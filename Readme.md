# Installation:
    // Rails 3.x
    $ gem 'fedex'

    // Rails 2.x
    $ gem install fedex

# Usage example:

Define the shipper:

    shipper = { :name => "Sender",
                :company => "Company",
                :phone_number => "555-555-5555",
                :address => "Main Street",
                :city => "Harrison",
                :state => "AR",
                :postal_code => "72601",
                :country_code => "US" }

Define the recipient:

    recipient = { :name => "Recipient",
                    :company => "Company",
                    :phone_number => "555-555-5555",
                    :address => "Main Street",
                    :city => "Franklin Park",
                    :state => "IL",
                    :postal_code => "60131",
                    :country_code => "US",
                    :residential => "false" }
Define the packages(multiple packages in a single shipment are allowed):
Note that all the Dimensions must be integers

    packages = []
    packages << { :weight => {:units => "LB", :value => 2},
                   :dimensions => {:length => 10, :width => 5, :height => 4, :units => "IN" } }
    packages << { :weight => {:units => "LB", :value => 6},
                   :dimensions => {:length => 5, :width => 5, :height => 4, :units => "IN" } }

By Default packaging type is "YOUR PACKAGING" and the drop off type is "REGULAR PICKUP", if you need something different you can pass an extra hash for shipping details

    shipping_details = { :packaging_type => "YOUR_PACKAGING", :drop_off_type => "REGULAR_PICKUP" }


Create a Fedex::Shipment object using your FedEx credentials; mode should be either production or development depending on what Fedex environment you want to use.

    require 'fedex'
    fedex = Fedex::Shipment.new(:key => 'xxx',
                                  :password => 'xxxx',
                                  :account_number => 'xxxx',
                                  :meter => 'xxx',
                                  :mode=>'production')

To find the rate

    rate = fedex.rate({:shipper=>shipper, :recipient => recipient, :packages => packages, :service_type => "FEDEX_GROUND", :shipping_details => shipping_details})

Fedex provides multiple total values; total_net_charge is the final amount you are looking for.

    $ rate.total_net_charge => "34.03"
    # Complete response
    $ <Fedex::Rate:0x1019ba5f8
          @total_net_charge="34.03",
          @total_surcharges="1.93",
          @total_billing_weight="8.0 LB",
          @total_taxes="0.0",
          @rate_type="PAYOR_ACCOUNT_PACKAGE",
          @total_base_charge="32.1",
          @total_freight_discounts=nil,
          @total_net_freight="32.1",
          @rate_zone="51">

To create a label for a shipment

    label = fedex.label({:filename => "example.pdf", :shipper=>shipper, :recipient => recipient, :packages => packages, :service_type => "FEDEX_GROUND", :shipping_details => shipping_details})

The label will be saved to the file system as the filename you specify and is Adobe PDF format.
